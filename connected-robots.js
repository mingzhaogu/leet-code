// You are given a list of robots, e.g.
// [a, b, c, d, e, f, g]
//
// And a list of connections, which is an array of tuples
// conn1 = [[a, b], [b, c], [c, d], [e, f], [f, g]]
//
// You are tasked to find the groups of robots that are connected to each
// other.
//
// In the example above,
// a-b-c-d
// e-f-g
//
// There are two groups of robots, the expected return is
// [[a, b, c, d], [e, f, g]]
